"""
This example demonstrates programming with blatann in an event-driven, object-oriented manner.
The BLE device is set up in the main context, however all logic past that point is done using
event callbacks.
The main context is blocked by a "GenericWaitable", which is notified when the program
completes its intended function.

The program's logic itself is equivalent to the central example, where it connects and pairs to a device,
registers a notification callback for the counting characteristic, then tests out the conversion of strings to hex.

One thing to note: when using event-driven callbacks, it is imperative that the callbacks themselves do
not ever block on events (i.e. use the .wait() functionality). If this happens, you are essentially blocking
the event thread from processing any more events and will wait indefinitely.
A good rule of thumb when using blatann is just to not mix blocking and non-blocking calls.

This is designed to work alongside the peripheral example running on a separate nordic chip
