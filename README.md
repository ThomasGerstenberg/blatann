# Blatann

bl√•tann: Norwegian word for "blue tooth"

The goal of this library is to provide a high-level, object-oriented interface
for performing bluetooth operations using the Nordic nRF52 through Nordic's `pc-ble-driver-py` library
and the associated Connectivity firmware.

### Install

`pip install blatann`

NOTE: if using Windows, you will first need to download and install Microsoft
Visual C++ 9.0 from [http://aka.ms/vcpython27](http://aka.ms/vcpython27)

#### Supported Devices/Software

This has been tested using both the nRF52832 Dev Kit and the [ABSniffer 528](https://blog.aprbrother.com/product/absniffer-usb-dongle-528) flashed with Connectivity Firmware

This API implements against Connectivity Firmware for SoftDevice v3 (nRF5 SDK version 12.3). This does NOT support the nRF51 or SoftDevice v2.
Additionally the nRF52840 is not compatible since it is not supported by this version of the SoftDevice.

Currently only Python 2.7 is supported. This is a limitation of the `pc-ble-driver-py` library only building the SWIG modules for v2.
If the aforementioned library ever supports Python 3+, this library will be updated also. Or, if I find spare time and this library
is stable I'll work on building the modules myself and remove pc-ble-driver-py as a dependency altogether.

The library aims to support both event-driven and procedural program styles. It takes similar paradigms from C#/.NET's event function signatures,
where event handlers are passed  `object sender, EventArgs e`. In addition, asynchronous function calls return a `Waitable` object which
can be waited on (with timeout) until the event associated with the function call returns.

**NOTE**

This library is very much a work in progress. Interfaces, objects, method names **will** change.


### Examples

There are several example scripts which showcase different functionality of the library under `blatann/examples`.
Examples can be run using `python -m blatann.examples [example_filename] [device_comport]`.

Example usage: `python -m blatann.examples scanner COM3`
